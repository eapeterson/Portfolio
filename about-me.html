  <section class="introduction-section"><h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my page! I am an educator and writer living just outside of Washington, D.C. I love crafting exciting and informative prose, and am always up for a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>I believe in trying new things as often as possible. Challenging your limits leads you to find skills you never knew you had.</p>

    <section class="location-section"><h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I grew up mostly in west Texas and moved to Virginia to attend The College of William and Mary. I love the D.C. area because there is always something happening. The rich mix of cultures in the area makes it the perfect place to <b>eat</b>, <b>drink</b>, <b>work</b>, and <b>play</b>.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>When I'm not working, I love reading and finding new places to nosh and hike.</p>
    <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
    <p>My major life goal is to see as much of the world as is safely possible. As the product of a multicultural family, I think travel can be one of the most positive experiences anyone can have. Therefore, my dream job would be being paid to travel and write.</p>
    <h2>What's your background?</h2>
    <p>I've been writing all my life, and have always loved children. I spend my days putting the two together!</p>
    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>I love a ridiculously wide range of music, but right now I've got OMFG's music on repeat. It's fun and doesn't contain many lyrics, so it's perfect as energetic background noise while I'm working.</p>
